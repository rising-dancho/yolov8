### in order to run or test this:
- python must also be installed on your machine (tick the `PATH` checkbox before installing python)
- create the `virtual environment`, activate the virtual environment using the `Command Prompt` (make sure you are in the `Scripts` directory where `activate.bat` is located)
- `cd` back to `backend` folder where the  `requirements.txt` is located and then run the command to install the packages
- once you're done with the instructions above, make sure you are in the `backend` folder then run this code in the `Command Prompt`:
  `python app.py`
- finally, install `Postman` so that you can test the `/process-image` route

### creating the virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
```

### activating the virtual environment: (run in command prompt)
```
cd .venv/Scripts
activate.bat
```

### install ultaralytics directly
```
pip install ultralytics
```

OR 

### installing packages from the requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### gitignore must include

```
# Python-related files
*.pyc
__pycache__/
*.pyo
*.pyd
*.egg-info/
*.egg
